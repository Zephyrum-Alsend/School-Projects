PART I

2.) Speed is important to reduce the time for the iteration process and also to implement
	the model before it becomes outdated. Every 6 months or so models should be updated
	so hopefully the simulation is fast enough to get a model into action before then.

3.) With unadjusted prices, values can suddenly double or half or some other crazy
	multiplication due to splits or spinoffs which can cause charts to fluctuate
	wildly. Indicators will mistake this sudden jump in price as something
	terribly wrong or terribly right and buy/sell when really nothing special is
	going on. Adjusted prices smooth out these jumps and keep the models from doing
	anything stupid.

4.) In physics and math, the problem's parameters are constant. Gravity is constant, pi
	is constant, the pull of magnetism per particle is constant -- which allows 
	mathematicians and physicists to take their time getting precise answers. The
	stock market is fluctuating constantly so the solution to the problem (of making
	a profit) is also fluctuating. One solution will only work for a period of time.

5.) Look-ahead bias is when a model, during simulation, pulls data that it theoretically
	should not have access to. For example, testing a model on 2003 - 2008 to predict
	how it works in 2009 and the model is fitted to data from 2009. It can easily
	cause overfitting a model and also depends upon data FROM THE FUTURE.

6.) The numbers would get quite large but that in of itself is not much of an issue.
	What is an issue is stocks are also traded in fractions of pennies. With an INT,
	how are decimal places stored? They aren't! So roundoff errors abound!

8.) C++ (excluding C) is the fastest higher level programming language in use. Simulation
	frameworks need to be fast and C++ provides that speed.

9.) When a stock's price gets exceptionally low, it is a sign of a weak business and 
	likely to disappear rather than grow. Investing in a stock below, say, 6$, that
	5$ invested may disappear as the stock price plummets due to business failure.
	Stocks above the threshold will stick around long enough to make a profit.

PART II

1.) NVIDIA and AMD are both manufacturers of graphics cards and often compared when debates
	of what card to buy arise on forums. As competitors in the same field, they should
	correlate.
	The resulting Correlation is -0.16795. It did not match expectations.
