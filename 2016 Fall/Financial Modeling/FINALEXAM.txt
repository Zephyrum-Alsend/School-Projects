1.) Text files will be faster to extract from and faster to overwrite with new data.
A vendor's SQL Database is more robust than a text file and vendors have more up to date information.

2.) Mistakes can be made in a GUI and graphical interfaces require more work behind the scenes to operate.
A configuration file is just plain text and can be easily read by a program.  Editing values is also faster.

3.) Successful models need to be successful consistently.  Obtaining the highest PNL may
optimize the model on a peak/spike, which will yield inconsistent or one-off success.

4.) Investing in the stock market has risk associated with it.  Hedges reduce the risk by
having a stake in something that always performs well, like SPY.

5.) It is impossible to see a pattern until after it happens.  Riding a stock until the 
pattern is recognized may have the position left at a bad time.  Limiting how long
reduces the risk of holding a position until it is detrimental.

6.) 

7.) The stock market is in constant flux; every model needs to be adjusted periodically
or it begins to perform poorly.

8.) A hit ratio is the ratio of profitable trades to unprofitable trades.  A hit ratio
of .44 is not necessarily bad because the minority of profitable trades could earn more 
than the unprofitable trades lost.  Vice versa for a hit ratio of .62.

9.) 

10.) 

12.) The data vendors provide is more up to date than free data.

13.) 

14.) The next step is to flip/reverse the indicators.  This may not work because not all
indicators should be flipped and a Sharpe Ratio of 4.2 is a little too good to be true.

15.) Testing over a population gives a better indication of how the model will perform across
various markets in various states.  A general sense of performance can be gathered by testing
over a decade or longer.  It also can prevent overfitting a model to a specific market and time.

16.) Unadjusted prices, over a period including a split or dividend, can throw the calculations
for a loop.

17.) Models in reference books are outdated and common knowledge.  When everyone uses the same
model, that model suddenly stinks (i.e. if everyone starts buying IBM, it'll throw the market into
a tizzy).  Models need to be adjusted periodically to fit the current market.

18.) Ducks.

(POINT II)
I looked at Microsoft (MSFT), S&P 500(^GSPC), NASDAQ(^IXIC) and Ubisoft(UEN.F) over the past year.

If the 5DMA is 2% higher or lower than the 50DMA, enter a position.
The price can fluctuate when the 5MDA and 50DMA are close to each other. Adding a buffer prevents these fluctuations from causing rapid shifts
in position.
 
If the 50DMA is 10%+ lower or higher than the 50DMA a month ago, exit position.  Do not re-enter that position for two weeks.
A trend among charts is that when this happened, the stock would fluctuate almost widely before recovering upwards.  The two week break keeps
us out of the volatile period.

If the 5DMA is 10% off from or crosses the 50DMA, exit position.
When the 5DMA gets 10% off from the 50DMA, the stock reverses direction shortly after or fluctuates widely.  It predicts the peak before it
turns.  This percentage can be adjusted for certain levels of risk.

If the 5DMA is within the 2% - 10% range, do not enter position if the 5DMA lowered by 5% compared to previous two day's 5DMA's.
This checks if the 5DMA is on a collision course with the 50DMA, predicting the stock will continue to lower in price.

If the 5DMA is within the -2% - -10% range, do not enter a position if the 5DMA increased by 5% compared to the previous two day's 5DMA's.
Same as above, but in the opposite direction.


Using the VWAP will give a truer sense of the average price.  Volume can also serve as an indicator of if a stock is being overtraded.
If, say, the volume traded has increased by 5% over yesterday, the current price trend may strengthen and the model will either enter
or refrain from exiting a position based on that.  Volume traded over time can also be used to tell when a stock is dropping off or
climbing up the market.  Combined with the DMA, we can decide if a stock should be abandoned or held for an extended period of time.
