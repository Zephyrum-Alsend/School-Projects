Tell Visual Studio where to find:
1. Include files
2. Library(s)
3. Tell the name of the library(s) (There's a pragma for this)

Close files
Close connections
Delete created space (new operator)

Derived classes create object of parent class.
Friend function has access to class privates.
Don't do friend classes unless cout (Makes output easier).

STL uses New and Delete behind the scenes.
