C++ has fstream
C has fopen, fprint, fread, fwrite, fclose, fscanf
OS has more features and more control
	atomic read&write
ifstream - read from file
ofstream - write to file
fstream - both

if+of for text files, no f

ifstream
constructor
	ifstream();	ifstream inf1;
	ifstream(const char *name, ios_base::openmode nModes = ios::in);
				   //scary bit here defaults \(^o^)/
open(const);
inf.is_open() == true(if open)/false(if not)
inf >> x >> y;	//Gets hung up if more than one data type
getline(inf, line);
inf.getline(char *buff, int);

inf.close();
inf.seekg(streampos pos);
basic_isteam &inf.read(char *buff, streamsize count);
inf.gcount();

flush();	//Dumps out buffer
outf.flush();

inf.eof() == true if at end of file
inf.clear(); //Clears file flags

& indicates a reference
