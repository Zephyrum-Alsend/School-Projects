Data Access
1. Keep data in memory
	Know how much memory is needed and rethink strat if too much mem
Common databases
	SQL Database - convenient but slow
	CSV files - text file and read by excel
	Binary files - can organize by type
	Shared memory

2. Record data in Vector/Array
	Make all vectors same size.

Stock data comes in FLoat
21.513 (float) -> 21.512995 (double)
* 10000
215129.945
(double)(int)215130.45 / 10000
//Gives the accuracy of a double, converted from float

vector<double> x;
x.reserve(2500); //reserves space/sets size yourself

Make single instance of class:
//Singleton Class!
Static Duck *GetInstance();
Static Duck *duckPtr;

Duck * Duck::duckPtr=NULL;
Duck * Duck::GetInstance()
{
	If(duckPtr != NULL) return duckPtr;
	duckPtr = new Duck;
	return duckPtr;
}
